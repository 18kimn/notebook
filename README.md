# notebook: a theme for VSCode

This is a port with only minor modifications of Yorick Peterse's
[Vim Paper](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/vim-paper) theme.

Minor differences between the two are because of VSCode's extensive token colors
and to avoid coloring all parts of VSCode the same shade.
