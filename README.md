# notebook: a theme for VSCode

This is a port with only minor modifications of Yorick Peterse's
[Vim Paper](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/vim-paper) theme.

Minor differences between the two are because of VSCode's extensive token colors
and to avoid coloring all parts of VSCode the same shade.

Available on [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/18kimn/notebook-theme) and 
the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=18kimn.notebook-theme).
